# ModTGP
Personal musings and guides on modding "The Genesis Project".

## Obligatory Introduction
A lot of these guide things for modding say "learn the basics of Java/C/C#/C++/Brainf\*\*k and get a degree in computer science before even ATTEMPTING to read through this." I'm not going to do that. C# or any programming knowledge at all, even if it's what your weird friend John told you behind the bleachers in middle school, will work in your favor if you decide to do any modding... however, if you're a lazy piece of shit who wants to raw dog it and probably get some diseases along the way, feel free to be a script kiddie and steal my code. I do not care.

## Setting Up
First of all, read [this](https://github.com/imadr/Unity-game-hacking) and extract the code from the game. I recommend taking assets as well, because it's more convenient to modify them. If I mention something alien and don't specify how to do it, assume it is in that guide.

This should go unsaid, but have a code editor. Going through all of this in something like the default Notepad is cruel and unusual punishment. If you don't have one, VSCode is the way; some people will tell you to use VIM, but they're just emos who like doing extra hard work and having dysfunctional keyboard shortcuts. Anyway.

Everything here is written from the standpoint of a Linux user. It's basically the same on MacOS and kind of similiar on Windows, but keep in mind I'm talking from my own perspective.
