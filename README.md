# ModTGP
Personal musings and guides on modding "The Genesis Project".

## Obligatory Introduction
A lot of these guide things for modding say "learn the basics of Java/C/C#/C++/Brainf\*\*k and get a degree in computer science before even ATTEMPTING to read through this." I'm not going to do that. C# or any programming knowledge at all, even if it's what your weird friend John told you behind the bleachers in middle school, will work in your favor if you decide to do any modding... however, if you're a lazy piece of shit who wants to raw dog it and probably get some diseases along the way, feel free to be a script kiddie and steal my code. I do not care.
